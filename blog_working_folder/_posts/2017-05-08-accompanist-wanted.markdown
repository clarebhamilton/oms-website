We are currently looking for an accompanist to assist the choral director with term time rehearsals (Fridays 7.30pm - 9.30pm) and concerts (usually four per year). The right person will be able to play piano to a reasonable standard and have very good sight-reading skills. Previous experience of accompanying vocal groups would be great but is not essential.

A modest "honorarium" and travelling expenses will be paid.

Our rehearsal venue, Ormskirk School, is 13 miles northeast of Liverpool and has good rail, road and bus links.

For further information contact Diane on 01695 624253 or email [omschoir.sec@gmail.com](omschoir.sec@gmail.com)
