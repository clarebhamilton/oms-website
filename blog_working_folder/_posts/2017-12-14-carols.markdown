A good turnout for our carol singing in Ormskirk town centre on Dec 9th, led by Dan our intrepid choral director, who joined us from a snowy Blackburn.
Thanks to all who came and sang, played or gave out fliers for the Christmas concert. Lovely festive refreshments afterwards – many thanks Betty!
 
If you liked the carols, you'll love our [concert](http://ormskirkmusicsociety.org.uk/diary.html) at St John’s the Baptist Church, Burscough next Saturday (16th Dec).
