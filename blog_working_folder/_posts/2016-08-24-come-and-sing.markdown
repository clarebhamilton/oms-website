**Do you like singing...then why not _come and sing_ with Ormskirk Music Society?**



On Friday 9 September 2016 at 7.30pm, the choir of Ormskirk Music Society are holding a 
FREE “come and sing” event at Ormskirk School, Wigan Road, Ormskirk L39 2AT. 
Everyone is welcome, whether or not you have sung with a choir before. All we ask is that you enjoy singing! 



We will be learning two choral classics, Handel’s ‘Zadok the Priest’ and ‘The Rhythm of Life’ from the musical, _Sweet Charity_. 
Full tuition, sheet music and refreshments will be provided. You can also meet existing members and find out more about the Society.
