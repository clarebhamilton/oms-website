What an enjoyable evening we had last night! 

Big thanks must go first and foremost to Phil and the choir for all their hard 
work. Another big thank you to Phil in his capacity as tenor soloist, giving 
us great performances of Puccini and Gilbert and Sullivan. We also had the privilege 
to hear soprano, Rochelle Hart, singing arias from _Tosca_ and _Don Giovanni_, and the 'Habenera' 
from _Carmen_. 

Willow Brass also put in some lovely performances, including a Quintet by Victor Ewald. This was 
not a piece I had come across before and it was nice to hear it. Thanks must also go to piano accompanist, 
Simon Passmore, and organist, Tom Cooper.

It seemed very fitting that the concert ended on a high with the audience on its feet, listening to the 
mighty Hallelujah Chorus.

Well done everyone!!
