It's not everyday you get to discover a really great piece of music you had never heard of before. This blogger had never even heard of the composer 
Swede, Kurt Atterberg. His B flat minor piano concerto was described by Grammophone Magazine as a "full-bloodedly romantic work of considerable sweep‚Äù inspired by Tchaikovsky. 
With [Tom Kimmance](https://www.facebook.com/tomkimmance/) joining us for the piano concerto, this concert is sure to set musical pulses racing.

No concert entitled "The Lands of the Midnight Sun" would be complete with some Sibelius and we can't wait to present his majestic second symphony.

The concert will be at [Ormskirk School](http://ormskirkmusicsociety.org.uk/contact.html) on 25 March 2017 at 7.30pm.

For further information and tickets contact Clare on 07906 129393 or email [clarebhamilton@hotmail.com](clarebhamilton@hotmail.com).
