So the orchestra is practising hard for the [Spring concert on 23 April 2016]({{site.mybaseurl}}/diary.html). 
We might not be ready to trade venues with the Vienna Philharmonic
yet but things are definitely starting to take shape. 

There's a string sectional rehearsal on tomorrow (Thursday 4 February) where we will
do some work on the Rachmaninov _Symphonic Dances_. It's a tough play but as always with Rachmaninov, the rewards are enormous.
