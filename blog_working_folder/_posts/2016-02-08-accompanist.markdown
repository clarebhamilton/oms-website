The [choir]({{site.mybaseurl}}/choir.html) of Ormskirk Music Society is looking for an accompanist to assist 
the choral director with term time rehearsals (Fridays 7.30pm - 9.30pm) 
and concerts (usually four per year). 

We are looking for someone who can play piano to a reasonable standard 
and has good sight-reading skills. Previous experience of 
accompanying vocal groups would be great but is not essential. 

Ormskirk is approximately 13 miles northeast of Liverpool and 
has good rail, road and bus links. 

A modest "honorarium" plus 
travelling expenses will be paid. 

Please contact Diane Meredith on
[omschoir.sec@gmail.com](mailto:omschoir.sec@gmail.com)
or 01695 624253 if you would like more information about this opportunity.
