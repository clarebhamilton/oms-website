We had a great response from the people of Ormskirk on Saturday when a group of us 
sung carols with brass accompaniment in the town centre. Over £100 
was raised for society funds, and we were also rewarded with many smiles and 
thank yous. 
 
Afterwards we were treated to delicious festive refreshments at the 
home of Margaret and Andrew Sackville. A lovely social occasion and a good chance 
to publicize [the concert](http://ormskirkmusicsociety.org.uk/diary.html) at St John’s the Baptist Church, Burscough next Saturday (17th Dec).
