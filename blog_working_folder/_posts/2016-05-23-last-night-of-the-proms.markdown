The choir and orchestra are now well into their preparations for our Last Night of 
the Proms themed concert on [2 July 2016]({{site.mybaseurl}}/diary.html), subtitled 'Music of the Four Countries'. 
This little extract comes from the 2015 Last Night and features the leader of the 
BBC Symphony Orchestra playing that famous solo from Sir Henry Wood's _Fantasia on British Sea Songs_, 
a.k.a. the Sailor's Hornpipe. Just to get you in the mood!

We've got a feast of music coming up from all around the Home Nations: a Welsh Rhapsody, an Irish 
Rhapsody, plus music from Scotland and of course England! It will all be rounded off with those Last 
Night staples, including Elgar's 'Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1'.

So, come along, sing along, and enjoy a great summer evening's entertainment. For details of tickets
