In 2017 Ormskirk Music Society celebrates its 50th anniversary as a joint choir and orchestra. 
The choir is seeking to appoint a new choral director for our enthusiastic mixed-voice choir of some 40 members which 
performs a cappella and accompanied by piano, small chamber ensemble and the Societyâ€™s orchestra. 
One independent choir concert and three joint concerts with the orchestra are undertaken during the year.

We are looking for a committed conductor to help us celebrate our 50th anniversary and take us forward; 
someone who can work closely with the Society and its musical director/orchestral conductor on concert planning 
and performance. The society offers a small honorarium for the choral director and pays travel expenses.

For further information contact Diane on 01695 624253 or email [omschoir.sec@gmail.com](omschoir.sec@gmail.com)
