That concert was quite something!!

Lots of notes for everyone and a big thank you to Jim for keeping us all together 
throughout. 

We started off with Suk's _Scherzo Fantastique_ which was no easy play but felt like something of a warm up 
in comparison with the challenges to come. A warm, flowing evocative piece in that fantastic, melodic Czech 
tradition, with a hint of mystery along the way.

Next came the mighty _Symphonic Dances_ by Rachmaninov. Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm - keep counting people!! - plus 
some typically Rachmaninov long melodies. I think we all felt quite energised by the end...and that was only the first half.

The second half saw us perform excerpts from Prokofiev's _Romeo and Juliet_ Suites. We had worked hard on this for many months and 
that really paid off. This probably sounds very "down to earth" but I never get tired of playing the 'Dance of the Knights' (yes, I mean 
the music from the _Apprentice_!!) To do this on Shakespeare's 400th anniversary felt very meaningful too.

As well as giving heartfelt thanks to Jim, the orchestra is so grateful to the many friends and guests who joined us for the 
performance. Thanks are also due to the members of the choir who helped to make the concert possible with their 
fantastic contribution to the front of house effort.

We are looking ahead now to our ["Last Night of the Proms"]({{site.mybaseurl}}/diary.html) concert on 2 July 2016. 
Hope you can join us!
