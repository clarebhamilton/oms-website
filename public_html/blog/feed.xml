        <title>Concert report - Spring orchestral concert</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;That concert was quite something!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of notes for everyone and a big thank you to Jim for keeping us all together 
throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off with Suk’s &lt;em&gt;Scherzo Fantastique&lt;/em&gt; which was no easy play but felt like something of a warm up 
in comparison with the challenges to come. A warm, flowing evocative piece in that fantastic, melodic Czech 
tradition, with a hint of mystery along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next came the mighty &lt;em&gt;Symphonic Dances&lt;/em&gt; by Rachmaninov. Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm - keep counting people!! - plus 
some typically Rachmaninov long melodies. I think we all felt quite energised by the end…and that was only the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half saw us perform excerpts from Prokofiev’s &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt; Suites. We had worked hard on this for many months and 
that really paid off. This probably sounds very “down to earth” but I never get tired of playing the ‘Dance of the Knights’ (yes, I mean 
the music from the &lt;em&gt;Apprentice&lt;/em&gt;!!) To do this on Shakespeare’s 400th anniversary felt very meaningful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as giving heartfelt thanks to Jim, the orchestra is so grateful to the many friends and guests who joined us for the 
performance. Thanks are also due to the members of the choir who helped to make the concert possible with their 
fantastic contribution to the front of house effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking ahead now to our &lt;a href=&quot;/oms-website/public_html/diary.html&quot;&gt;“Last Night of the Proms”&lt;/a&gt; concert on 2 July 2016. 
Hope you can join us!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Concert report - the Choir of Ormskirk Music Society...and guests</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What an enjoyable evening we had last night!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big thanks must go first and foremost to Phil and the choir for all their hard 
work. Another big thank you to Phil in his capacity as tenor soloist, giving 
us great performances of Puccini and Gilbert and Sullivan. We also had the privilege 
to hear soprano, Rochelle Hart, singing arias from &lt;em&gt;Tosca&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Don Giovanni&lt;/em&gt;, and the ‘Habenera’ 
from &lt;em&gt;Carmen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willow Brass also put in some lovely performances, including a Quintet by Victor Ewald. This was 
not a piece I had come across before and it was nice to hear it. Thanks must also go to piano accompanist, 
Simon Passmore, and organist, Tom Cooper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed very fitting that the concert ended on a high with the audience on its feet, listening to the 
mighty Hallelujah Chorus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well done everyone!!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rachmaninov: learning from the best...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of really great resources online for classical musicians.
None of them is perhaps as valuable as an extra hour of practice every 
week, but nevertheless, there is some good stuff out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this very timely and relevant resource a couple of days ago. The 
Sydney Symphony Orchestra has quite an active online presence and as part of this 
they have posted a whole series of masterclasses on YouTube. I was particularly
interested in this video. It shows 
the concertmaster of the orchestra (we would call him the leader of the orchestra in the UK) 
giving a young violinist some constructive criticism about his performance of 
a section from the first movement of Rachmaninov’s Symphonic Dances, which the 
&lt;a href=&quot;/oms-website/public_html/orchestra.html&quot;&gt;orchestra of Ormskirk Music Society&lt;/a&gt; is playing 
in our &lt;a href=&quot;/oms-website/public_html/diary.html&quot;&gt;concert&lt;/a&gt; on 23 April 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section in question is a very magical moment in the piece and is definitely 
one of those passages we string players look forward to. Lots of passion, 
maximum vibrato, Rachmaninov at his passionate best. If you watch the video you 
will learn that the section was actually bowed and edited at Rachmaninov’s 
request by the great &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Kreisler&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fritz Kreisler&lt;/a&gt;. 
There’s some star quality for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I had watched the video, I picked up my violin and it really did sound 
better than it did before. Let’s hope we can take some inspiration from 
Maestro Kreisler right here in West Lancashire.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Accompanist needed</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/oms-website/public_html/choir.html&quot;&gt;choir&lt;/a&gt; of Ormskirk Music Society is looking for an accompanist to assist 
the choral director with term time rehearsals (Fridays 7.30pm - 9.30pm) 
and concerts (usually four per year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who can play piano to a reasonable standard 
and has good sight-reading skills. Previous experience of 
accompanying vocal groups would be great but is not essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ormskirk is approximately 13 miles northeast of Liverpool and 
has good rail, road and bus links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modest “honorarium” plus 
travelling expenses will be paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please contact Diane Meredith on
&lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#105;&amp;#114;&amp;#046;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#105;&amp;#114;&amp;#046;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;
or 01695 624253 if you would like more information about this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rehearsals underway</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So the orchestra is practising hard for the &lt;a href=&quot;/oms-website/public_html/diary.html&quot;&gt;Spring concert on 23 April 2016&lt;/a&gt;. 
We might not be ready to trade venues with the Vienna Philharmonic
yet but things are definitely starting to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a string sectional rehearsal on tomorrow (Thursday 4 February) where we will
do some work on the Rachmaninov &lt;em&gt;Symphonic Dances&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a tough play but as always with Rachmaninov, the rewards are enormous.&lt;/p&gt;
